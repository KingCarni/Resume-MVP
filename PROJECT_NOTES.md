Resume Builder — MVP Spec (v0.1)
Goal: Help users tailor their resume truthfully to a job posting by improving wording, structure, and keyword alignment—without inventing experience.

Core features (MVP):

Resume import: PDF/DOCX upload → extract text → split into sections and bullets.

Job posting input: paste job description.

Analyze match: show keyword coverage + gap analysis.

Rewrite bullet: rewrite individual bullets for alignment while preserving facts.

Cover letter generator: uses extracted resume + job post.

Graphs: simple charts showing match score, keyword coverage, section strength.

Non-negotiable constraints:

Never claim the user worked at the target company.

Never invent employers, titles, dates, tools, or metrics.

If info is missing, either keep it general or ask the user to supply it.

Output should be ATS-friendly and easy to copy.

Later (post-MVP):

“Truth Contract”

Candidate experience is immutable.

Job post is for alignment only.

No invented facts.
